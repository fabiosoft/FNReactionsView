## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 3.0+

## Usage

### Reaction

A `FNReactionsView` object is a simple view

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    reactionsView = FNReactionsView()
    if let reactionsView = reactionsView{
        reactionsView.backgroundColor = .clear
        view.addSubview(reactionsView)
        
        reactionsView.snp.makeConstraints({ (make) in
            make.top.left.right.equalToSuperview()
            make.height.equalTo(300)
        })
    }
}
```
(thanks to [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) for easy constraints handling)

For easy demonstration you can add a tap gesture to trigger the animation in you `viewDidLoad`

```swift
view.addGestureRecognizer(UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handleTap)))
```
and the handler

``` swift
func handleTap(){
    let reactions = [#imageLiteral(resourceName: "love"), #imageLiteral(resourceName: "angry"), #imageLiteral(resourceName: "ill"), #imageLiteral(resourceName: "devil")]
    (0...10).forEach { (_) in
        let image = reactions[Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(reactions.count)))]
        reactionsView?.showReaction(image: image)
    }
}
```

## Installation

#### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your *Podfile* and add _FNReactionsView_:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

use_frameworks!
pod 'FNReactionsView'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file):

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

You can now `import FNReactionsView` framework into your files.

#### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/fabiosoft/FNReactionsView/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `FNReactionsView` folder into your project to use it in.
